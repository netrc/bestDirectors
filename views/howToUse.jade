        p.
          This site is a fun way to interact with the movie ratings and director information from the IMDB.
          If you're trying to find out the best director, or if one director is better than another, can you use
          this data to answer that question? Perhaps.
        p.
          It's easy to ask analytical questions about the data, a little harder to justify calling the results
          a list of "the best" or "better than. As long as we don't take the results too seriously, we can use
          this analysis to find out some interesting relationships about some of our favorite directors and their
          films and to discover some names and movies that we've never heard of before.

          Let's start with <a href="http://bestdirectors.netrc.com/?minNumVotes=10&minNumFilms=10"> min num votes set to 10 and min num films set to 10 </a>. There
          are a lot of people.
          One cogent suggest for best director would be more than 10 movies with a substantial following, lets say more than 500 votes. After all, a great director
          may only make a modest number of films.
          Or you might say that a great director will have made a lot of good-to-great movies. How many is a lot? Tring 30 movies with 500.
          Let's look for some people that make lots and lots of movies, 100 votes and 50 movies.

          The <a href="http://imdb.org">Internet Movie Database</a> is a brilliant online resource for movie fans.
          Signigicantly, it owes its vast cache of information to volunteers who add information.
          The data is vetted, and perhaps surprisingly, is the most accurate and widespread source of information about movies.
          Note this that and the other.
          There are NNNN total movies tracked by the IMDB.
        h2#Ratings About Ratings
        p. 
          In addition to cast lists and production credits, the database also allows you to enter your personal rating for
          each film using a scale of 1 - horrible! - to 10 - perfection itself.
          IMDB keeps track of the number of votes.
          Note that of the NNNN movies, only YYYY (or xx%) have any votes at all.
          Taking each movies rating (excluding movies with no votes), shows an average rating of...
          A graph of the number of movies for each rating. This shows that highly rated movies are quite rare, only X% over 8.
          Perhaps this is as it should be.
        h2#Votes About Number of Votes
        p.
          IMDB also tracks the number of votes for each movie that has been rated. Looking at the number of votes cast versus the
          rating shows a trend towards "better" movies getting more votes.
